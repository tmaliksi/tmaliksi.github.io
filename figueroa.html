<h1>The CMSC in ME:</h1>

<p>The REAL reason for taking CMSC:
<br> I took CMSC because like using gadgets like PC, console etc., so I took the liberty 
to understand how their operating system works.
</p>

<p>Favorite CMSC SUBJECT so far:
<br> CMSC 22 is my favorite subject so far because I had fun learning Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) Language, specifically Java. I find the course very interesting and I enjoyed
making my project. 
</p>


<p>Favorite PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE so far:
<br> My favorite programming language so far is Java because I find its syntax very simple and 
easy to familiarize with. In terms of garbage collection, unlike in C or C++, a programmer
doesn't have to worry about memory (most of the time). It's relatively easy to make programs
and its portable since Java really does run well on all the popular platforms.
